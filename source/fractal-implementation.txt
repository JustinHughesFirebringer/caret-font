Fractal Glyph System Implementation

1. Fractal Structure Rules
- Each glyph consists of a primary orbital with 3-5 recursive branches
- Each branch reduces in size by ~40% at each iteration
- Maximum of 3 recursive levels to maintain readability
- Branches maintain consistent angular relationships

2. Scaling Factors
Primary Orbital: 1.0x (base size)
Level 1 Branches: 0.8x
Level 2 Branches: 0.6x
Level 3 Branches: 0.4x

3. Connection Rules
- Branches connect at node points on parent orbital
- Connection paths curve smoothly between levels
- Connection angle ranges: 30째, 150째, 270째 (120째 separation)
- Path thickness reduces proportionally with scale

4. Recursive Elements
Base Components:
- Orbital rings (concentric circles)
- Node points
- Connecting paths
- Internal markers

Recursive Pattern:
- Each branch inherits parent's internal structure
- Maintains proportional relationships
- Preserves geometric alignment
- Reduces detail complexity with scale

5. Implementation Guidelines
Font Creation:
- Use compound paths for efficient scaling
- Define recursive components as reusable symbols
- Implement automatic detail reduction at smaller sizes
- Maintain minimum stroke width thresholds

Variations:
- Alter branch angles for different characters
- Vary internal patterns for distinction
- Modify connection paths for different relationships
- Adjust recursion depth for complexity
