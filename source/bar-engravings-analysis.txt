Bar Engraving Character Analysis

Physical Characteristics:
- Characters appear etched/engraved into curved surface
- Character height: approximately 1/3 of bar width
- Consistent stroke width throughout
- Characters flow horizontally along curve
- Slight vertical compression due to curved surface

Character Properties:
1. Base Forms
- Angular geometric shapes combined with curved elements
- Characters appear to be part of a unified writing system
- Consistent baseline alignment despite curved surface
- Possible right-to-left or left-to-right directionality

2. Stroke Analysis
- Primary strokes: thin, precise lines
- Secondary elements: smaller geometric shapes
- Junction points: clean, angular connections
- Terminal points: sharp, defined endings

3. Character Components
- Linear elements with geometric endings
- Small circular or dot-like elements
- Angular connections between strokes
- Possible diacritical or modifier marks

4. Pattern Observations
- Repeating geometric elements
- Consistent character spacing
- Possible syllabic or logographic system
- Characters maintain readability despite curved surface

5. Font Development Notes
- Need to account for curved surface distortion in reference images
- Maintain consistent stroke width in digital recreation
- Preserve angular precision of connections
- Consider both flat and curved display contexts
- Design characters to work in both positive and negative (engraved) forms
