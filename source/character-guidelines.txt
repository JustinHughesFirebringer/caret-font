Character Construction Guidelines

1. Base Structure
- Start with primary circular base
- Establish central axis
- Define connection points

2. Orbital Elements
- Layer circular paths concentrically
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Add directional indicators

3. Node Placement
- Position primary nodes at key intersections
- Secondary nodes at path transitions
- Tertiary nodes for detail points

4. Path Construction
- Use BÃ©zier curves for flowing lines
- Maintain smooth transitions
- Balance thick and thin strokes

5. Detail Elements
- Add internal geometric patterns
- Include orbital markers
- Place decorative elements

6. Character Spacing
- Define side bearings
- Account for overlapping elements
- Establish kerning pairs

Reference Characters:
A: Primary orbital with three nodes
B: Dual circular base with connecting path
C: Single base with extended orbital
D: Complex node network with multiple paths
E: Geometric base with radiating elements
