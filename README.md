# CARET Font Project

A font recreation project based on the CARET Q4-86 Research Report character system.

## Project Structure
- `source/` - Contains source files for font development
- `reference/` - Reference images and documentation
- `dist/` - Generated font files

## Character Features
- Circular orbital patterns
- Flowing curved elements
- Interconnected nodes and paths
- Geometric precision with organic flow
- Both solid and outlined elements

## Development Notes
- Base character height appears consistent
- Characters feature both thick and thin strokes
- Circular elements often contain internal details
- Characters appear to flow from left to right
- Some characters show nested orbital patterns
